# Stock---Analysis
## OVERVIEW
### 1. Background: 
Steve's parents are interested in the analysis of few stocks, specifically DAQO's. They want to know how actively DQ was trading (comparing 2017 and 2018).    
  
### 2. Steve's Objectives:
- Keep track of total daily volume (total number of shares traded throughout a day)
- Obtain yearly return for each stock
 
### 3. Main Goal:
Steve wants to enable macros on his computer in order to run the analysis whenever he wants with the least amount of time.  To do that, an existing code will be refactored in order to make his daily tasks more efficient by shortening the time the analysis runs.
