# Stock---Analysis
## OVERVIEW
### 1. Background: 
Steve's parents are interested in some stocks analysis, especially DAQO's. Specifically, they want to know how actively DQ was trading (comparing 2017 and 2018).    
  
### 2. Objectives:
- Keep track of total daily volume (total number of shares traded throughout a day)
- Obtain yearly return for each stock
- Also, Steve wants to enable macros on his computer in order to run the analysis whenever he wants
